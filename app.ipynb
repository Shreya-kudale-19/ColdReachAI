## Before we start - some setup:

/*
Please visit Sendgrid at: https://sendgrid.com/
(Sendgrid is a Twilio company for sending emails.)
If SendGrid gives you problems, see the alternative implementation using "Resend Email" in community_contributions/2_lab2_with_resend_email
Please set up an account - it's free! (at least, for me, right now).
Once you've created an account, click on:
Settings (left sidebar) >> API Keys >> Create API Key (button on top right)
Copy the key to the clipboard, then add a new line to your .env file:
`SENDGRID_API_KEY=xxxx`
And also, within SendGrid, go to:
Settings (left sidebar) >> Sender Authentication >> "Verify a Single Sender"  
and verify that your own email address is a real email address, so that SendGrid can send emails for you.
